Over all goal of the project is to get the routers to forward any traffic accross the network
NO JAVA because the ability to minipulate packet headers is impossable in java.
IT CAN be done in C, C++, generally succsessfully 
CODE on how routers work that minipulates headers.

Virtual router is simmiler to a real one. has physical ports - physical connections. 

The router pretends to have physical connections. One soccet for each connection, each line. so R1 has 3 network interfaces.

only 10.0.0.1 belongs to R1, 
but how many addresses does R1 have? 10, 3 ipv4, 3 ip, 3 mac, 1 hidden
